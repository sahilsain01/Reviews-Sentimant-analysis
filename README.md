# Sentiment Analysis Project using Hugging Face Transformers 🤖✨

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis project! In this notebook, we leverage the powerful Hugging Face Transformers library to build a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis model. 🚀


## 🔍 Overview

This project aims to classify text data into positive and negative sentiments using a pre-trained transformer model. Below is the workflow:

Data Loading and Preprocessing 📂

Load text data and clean it for model input.
Hugging Face Transformer Integration 🛠️

Use Hugging Face's pre-trained models for natural language processing tasks.
Model Training and Fine-Tuning 🧠

Train the transformer model on the dataset to enhance its sentiment analysis capabilities.
Evaluation and Visualization 📊

Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and generate visualizations for better understanding.

## 🚀 Features

Hugging Face Transformers: Use pre-trained models like bert-base-uncased or others to achieve high accuracy.


Custom Training: Fine-tune the pre-trained model for the sentiment dataset.


Visualization: Generate graphs and metrics to visualize the model's performance.
## 📋 Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

1. transformers: For leveraging Hugging Face's 
pre-trained transformer models.

2. torch: Provides deep learning capabilities and GPU acceleration.

3. pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
4. numpy: For numerical operations and matrix computations.

5. matplotlib: For creating visualizations like confusion matrices.

6. scikit-learn: For evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
